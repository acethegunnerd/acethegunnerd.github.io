                <p class="jetbrains-mono">Hi. I'm Ace, a teenager who likes to do a lot of things.</p>
                <p class="jetbrains-mono"> <br> I am also a Christian. I want to become more of a Christian and align with Christian values. Hopefully through my gifts, I can spread the word of God to even more people. </p>
                <p class="jetbrains-mono"> <br> I believe God has given me many blessings. Lots of times, I take them for granted, but I need to be more appreciative of them. He has given me an opportunity too valuable to pass up, and that's to be gracious, giving, and kind to others.</p>
                <p class="jetbrains-mono"> <br> On a different note, I like a lot of different things. Engineering catches my eye a lot. I've gotten into robotics for the last 4 years, and it has been amazing. Without getting into robotics, I would probably be focusing on an entirely different field right now. My programming journey started with Java to program the robot we built in robotics club. Robotics has taught me many other things as well, such as CAD (Computer-Aided Design) to 3D model precise real-world applied parts. Using this in robotics is crucial because if you know how to CAD, you can 3D print/CNC machine any robot part you can imagine.</p>
                <p class="jetbrains-mono"> <br> I try to expand my skills with every chance I can. I've tried graphic design, video editing (in capcut), web development (of which you see now), 2D modelling and (sometimes, but very rarely) animation in sticknodes, and I'm also looking ahead to what I can do in the future. Hopefully, I might one day be able to tackle Blender for free-form 3D modelling, but holy cow, that stuff seems VERY otherworldly to me. While I am very, very far from mastering these skills, I feel like choosing to pick these up now instead of later will help me in the long run.</p>
                <p class="jetbrains-mono"> <br> Jack of many trades, master of none... yet.</p>
